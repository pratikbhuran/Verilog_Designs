# Voting_Machine 
Example of a voting machine implemented in both Behavioral model and Structural model.
The design was first implemented in behavioral and then in structural using components.

## Behavioral model
The behavioral model is designed by using the finite state machine. This gives a clear understanding of its working. 

## Structural model
It is made by adding an asynchronous reset up counter as its components. The number of counters added dpend upon the number of candidates to vote for.
