# Voting Machine

The voting machine is designed for 3 candidates with output size of 32 bits. Used the state machine approach comprising of 4 states idle, vote, stop and finish. Runs on clock frequncy 10MHz.

There is another combinational always block that runs on clock signal whereas the always block of state machine works on state and inputs. 
simulated on Multisim 10.4 and Active HDL.
